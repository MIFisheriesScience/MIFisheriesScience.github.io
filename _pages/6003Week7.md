We will continue our exploration of GLMs this week, looking at how GLM's can be applied to data expressed as zeroes and ones, proportions, rates, and more.

This lecture will be a bit different than others. We will cover many topics in very brief detail. But each of these topics could be its own lecture. Consequently, I will 'name-drop' several techniques, simply state what they are and when they might be used, and encourage self-study. 

### Lecture Topics

* GLM's for data expressed as zeroes and ones, proportions, and rates
* Contrast Bernoulli, Binomial, and Beta regression
* In brief: Multinomial and cumulative logistic regression (i.e. what to do when Y is categorical)
* Simulating from the model as a validation step
		
### In-class Activities

As always, this class will have a mixture of R code and lecture slides

### Resources

Beta regression:... excuse the similar-sounding names. Each of the below articles comes at it a bit differently.

* [Mangiafico: Beta regression for percent and proportion data](http://rcompanion.org/handbook/J_02.html)
* [Zeileis et al: Beta regression in R](https://eeecon.uibk.ac.at/~zeileis/papers/ERCIM-2010.pdf)
* [Prabhakaran: Beta regerssion with R](http://r-statistics.co/Beta-Regression-With-R.html)
* [Cribari-Neto and Zeileis: Beta regression in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/betareg/vignettes/betareg.pdf)

We will use data from the below paper for one exercise. Read if you like:
