Welcome to graduate school! It has been said that grad school is where you transition from becoming a **knowledge-consumer** to a **knowledge-producer.** In Week 1 we will explore what this means, and discuss how to make the most out of your time as a graduate student at the Marine Institute.

### Lecture Topics
* Overview of the MI Fisheries Science graduate program
* Discuss knowledge production - what do scientists do all day?
* Concept: The workflow of science. Explain how each MI fisheries course supports this workflow 
* Why communicate? 
    + Inside the ivory tower:   
        - Communication (i.e. paper) as the fundamental unit of scientific credit
        - The workflow of science is fundamentally based on communication
    + Outside the ivory tower:
        - Managing fisheries is managing people - achieving this requires engagement
        - The public pays for our work and they should get to hear about it
        - Scientific literacy - if scientists don't speak, who will?
* Introduction to reference management (with emphasis on Zotero)

### In-class Activities

* Round-table introductions
* Becoming Discoverable: Set up a [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/) profile and [ORCID](http://orcid.org/) (https://scholar.google.ca/ and http://orcid.org/)
* Download and install [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/download/) 
* Begin Individual Development Plan

### Resources

I strongly recommend (but stop short of requiring) that you purchase copies of the course reference books:

Heard, Stephen B (2016). *The Scientist’s Guide to Writing: How to Write More Easily and Effectively Throughout Your Scientific Career*. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, p. 255. ISBN:
9780691170220.

#### Other recommended resources

Olson, Randy (2015). *Houston, We Have a Narrative: Why Science Needs Story*. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, p. 256. ISBN: 9780226270845.

I also recommend you visit http://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules - a series of papers that provide introductory advice to many topics relevant to reserachers.

Eisen, J (2014). Using Google scholar in scholarly workflows. (http://www.googblogs.com/using-google-scholar-in-scholarly-workflows/)

Here are some excellent videos to get you started with Zotero: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYspUZGexLdDLjHRkuERQlg/videos

## Details

### Introduction Activity
Students pair up with someone they don't know. In pairs:

- Student A: Introduces student B (< 1 min): Name, supervisor, where they did undergrad (and M.Sc) degrees.
- Student B: Introduces themsleves (< 3 min): How did you get INTO research? And a random fact!
(and vice versa)

(5 min prep, 10 min per pair)

### Google Scholar, ORCID, and Zotero
Students will be introduced to each of the above products and will be encouraged to register for them.
