Part 2 of our deep-dive into the scientific manuscript. Today, we will continue by talking about the discussion, and will focus especially on the concept of a Topic Sentence and how it relates to good writing.

### Lecture Topics

* Paper sections: Discussion, acknowledgments, and figures and tables
* Focus: Topic sentences. What are they, and what are they for?
* Focus: Abstracts

# Readings

Please read the [Nature guide to abstracts](http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/gta/Letter_bold_para.doc) in advance of the lecture.

Also, please **download this redacted version** of Nagasawa and Tadokoro (1996) and read it. Please don't go and download the original paper - we are going to write our own abstract for this in class!

## Activities

We will introduce a new weekly activity - team-based goal setting. We will do our power 1/4 hr as well.

We will do an activity related to topic sentences. I will provide some paragraphs from papers with the topic sentence removed. In pairs, you will craft topic sentences.

We will wrap up with an abstract activity.
