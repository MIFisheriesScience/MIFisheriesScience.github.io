## April 3, 2018

Nearly every scientist will have to do a literature review at some point. Many will have to do this quantitatively. In this lecture we explore the concept of the meta-analysis - what they are, what they're for, and how to do them well.

### Lecture Topics

* Systematic vs. unsystematic literature reviews
* Introduction to the term "Meta-Analysis"
* Basic logic of MA, including effect sizes
* PRISMA and MA reporting

By the end of this class

### Resources
 
There are several R packages that can be used to conduct meta-analysis. I've used the first one, and dabbled in the second. I have no experience with the third, but it looks good.

This textbook is **godlike**, and is a must-have if you intend to embark on a meta-analysis:

And some food-for-thought about MA drawbacks:

*Define your MA properly:*
- [Vetter, D., Rücker, G., & Storch, I. (2013). Meta‐analysis: A need for well‐defined usage in ecology and conservation biology. Ecosphere, 4(6), 1-24.](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/ES13-00062.1)

*Don't ask silly MA questions:*
- [Smith, G. C., & Pell, J. P. (2003). Parachute use to prevent death and major trauma related to gravitational challenge: systematic review of randomised controlled trials. BMJ: British Medical Journal, 327(7429), 1459.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC300808/)

Bonus points if you download and cite my MA from my Ph.D (kidding) (not really) (no, really I am kidding) (or am I?) Note especially our supplementary material, including a tracking spreadsheet for the literature included and excluded in the MA.

- [Favaro, B., & Côté, I. M. (2015). Do by‐catch reduction devices in longline fisheries reduce capture of sharks and rays? A global meta‐analysis. Fish and fisheries, 16(2), 300-309.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/faf.12055)
