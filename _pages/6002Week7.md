Visually displaying data through figures is a critical part of producing high quality science. The amount of information you can glean from a well-designed figure is impressive, and so today we will learn how to make basic figures in R.

### Lecture Topics
* Working with dates

* ggplot2 vs. base plot
* Contrasting plots for common data types
