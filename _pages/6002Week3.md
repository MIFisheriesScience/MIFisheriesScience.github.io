We want to work seamlessly, painlessly, and in such a way that you can easily find code and data many years after completing a project.

This week, we will cover RMarkdown - a language that allows integration of text and R code. We will also cover best-practices in arranging project folders.

### Lecture Topics

* What is workflow?
* Using RProjects to organize workflow
* Best practices in arranging project folders
