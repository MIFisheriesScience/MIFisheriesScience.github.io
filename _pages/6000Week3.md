Before we can do science, we have to convince someone to let us do the research. The lifecycle of most research projects begins with a proposal, and every grad student does a proposal as part of their research program. Today's lecture will focus on this critical step.

### Lecture Topics

* What are proposals for, and what types of things get proposed?
* Crafting excellent research questions
  - Intro to literture searches
* Just read the instructions! (Study the criteria of a grant, scholarship, or proposal before you start writing)
* How (and who) to ask for a reference letter

### In-class Activities

* Build a proposal 
* Power 1/4 hour
