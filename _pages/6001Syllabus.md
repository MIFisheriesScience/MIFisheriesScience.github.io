# Course Description

In this overview course on fisheries science, researchers from the School of Fisheries will deliver two week modules on their areas of expertise. Students will be exposed to the diversity of research conducted at MI - including fisheries ecology, conservation and sustainability, harvesting technology, post-capture processing, and fisheries policy.

# Course Instructors

This course will cover six units, each delivered by a different faculty member in the SOF:

| Date | Email |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Dr. Paul Winger | Paul.Winger@mi.mun.ca |
| Dr. Arnault Le Bris | Arnault.LeBris@mi.mun.ca | 
| Dr. Jonathan Fisher | Jonathan.Fisher@mi.mun.ca | 
| Dr. Scott Grant | Scott.Grant@mi.mun.ca | 
| Dr. Sherrylynn Rowe | Sherrylynn.Rowe@mi.mun.ca | 
| Dr. Deepika Dave | Deepika.Dave@mi.mun.ca | 

Contact module instructors directly to discuss that component of the course.

[Dr. Brett Favaro](Brett.Favaro@mi.mun.ca) is the course facilitator and is involved in organization of the course, but not delivery. Only contact him with questions about the course that don't pertain to specific content.

# Reference Books

Unit instructors will provide reading lists associated with each unit. In a general sense, we recommend the following textbook as a general introduction to fisheries science:

Jennings, S., Kaiser, M., Reynolds, J.D. (2001). Marine Fisheries Ecology. Wiley-Blackwell, Hoboken NJ. 432 pp. 

The library has two copies of this text.

# Course Policies 

## Social Media
Ask your module instructor.

## Digital Competency
Students are expected to have basic computer competency. You should be able to operate Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, and Excel, or equivalent (e.g. [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) or [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/)). You should be able to download and install software onto your computer. Please install [R Statistical Software](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) prior to begining the course. 

If you lack these skills, please consult [training materials](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/training.aspx) on your own time. **Please bring a laptop to every class.**

## E-mail Policy
E-mail is not a primary tool for communication in this class. If you have questions about course content, your order of operation should be: 

1. Check the syllabus and assignment guides
2. Ask in class, or discuss with colleagues
3. Ask on Slack (this way, everyone can benefit from an answer)
4. Request a meeting with the module instructor
5. Request a meeting with the course manager

If emailing a meeting request, use the subject line "FISH 6001: Meeting request" Please indicate three potential meeting times and explain in 1-3 lines what you want to meet about. 

## Class Participation

Accomodations will be made for serious illness or other extenuating circumstances. However, it is the student's responsibility to stay caught up with course materials - and missing in-class activities will result in a decreased participation grade.

So please, don't miss class! 

## Academic Honesty
This course is governed by MUN's [regulations on academic misconduct](http://www.mun.ca/regoff/calendar/sectionNo=REGS-0748).
