In this week's lecture we will discuss the simple (bivariate) linear regression model. This will be our gateway into the topic of regression-type analyses.

### Lecture Topics

* How to draw and fit a line
* Basic concepts and terminology of linear regression
* Demonstrating how to fit and assess a basic linear model
	
### In-class Activities

This will be a theory-heavy lecture. That said, students may wish to follow along with my Week 3 code, which demonstrates how to produce all the figures and models in today's lecture. 

### Pre-class Prep

**Optional**

The data I use to illustrate linear models in today's class are taken from:

[Huang et al. (2017), Sooty tern (Onychoprion fuscatus) survival, oil spills, shrimp fisheries, and hurricanes. PeerJ 5:e3287; DOI 10.7717/peerj.3287](https://peerj.com/articles/3287/)
