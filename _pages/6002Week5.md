# October 11 and 12, 2017

This week we will continue our exploration of graph-making in R. We now know how to make plots, but let's learn to make them beautiful and easier to interpret.

### Lecture Topics
* Comparison of base plot and ggplot2 for scatterplots and barplots
* Basic syntax for above
* Using colour and gradients
* Pros and cons of ggplot2 vs base
* Specialty plots for:
 - Paired points
 - Proportions
 - Time series

### Resources

The most important resource this week is the [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

## Details: Week 5

## Activities

Everyone should make one publication-quality plot from the BrettsCar dataset, incorporating a few design elements. These elements could include:
- colour scales
- altered axes
- interesting use of themes

## Code and Data
* [Week 5 code](/assets/images/FISH6002-Week5.R)
* [Week 5 data - same as week 4 data](/assets/images/6002Week4_BrettsCar.csv)
