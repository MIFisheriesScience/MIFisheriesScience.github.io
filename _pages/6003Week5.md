At this point we know how to specify, execute, and interpret output from linear models. But how do we know if they're even working?

This week we will focus on model specification - how to determine what covariates to include, and how to assess whether the model has fit your data well.

### Lecture Topics

* Model validation
* Standardization of covariates
* Variance Inflation Factor  
* Model selection
		
### In-class Activities

As always, this class will have a mixture of R code and lecture slides

### Pre-class Prep

Please read:

Full comprehension is not expected at this stage.
