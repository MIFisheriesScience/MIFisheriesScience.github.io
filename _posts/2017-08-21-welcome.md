The new semester approaches quickly, and so it is time to get the course websites up and ready to go. Here you will find direct links to two types of documents.

First you will find course materials for FISH 6000 (Science Communication for Fisheries) and FISH 6002 (Data Collection, Management, and Display). Eventually,
FISH 6003 (Statistics and Study Design for Fisheries Science) will be there as well. The page includes a syllabus for each course, an assignment guide, and a weekly
page that will include an outline and lecture notes. 

The second link (program documents) will index helpful documents that we have put together to assist in navigating your way through graduate school.

In the future, I will use this page primarily to communicate information about ongoing courses. Think of this like a living course textbook.
